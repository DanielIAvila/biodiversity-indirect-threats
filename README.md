# Biodiversity Indirect Threats

This repository contains the required scripts, raw data and preprocessed files for the article **"What is the evidence on indirect drivers of biodiversity loss worldwide? A systematic map protocol" (in review).** 

The article is a _systematic map protocol_ following the [Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2046-4053-4-1), complemented with the [Guidelines and Standards for Evidence Synthesis in Environmental Management from the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence](https://environmentalevidence.org/information-for-authors/), incorporating the [Reporting standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses (ROSES)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13750-018-0121-7).

In this protocol, we established the required steps to conduct a systematic review on biodiversity indirect threats, aiming to answer the following research questions:

<ol type="I">
  <li>
    <strong>What is the evidence on the indirect drivers of biodiversity loss worldwide?</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>How many studies explicitly identify and describe indirect drivers in the context of direct drivers of biodiversity loss? Where have these studies been conducted?</li>
      <li>How have indirect drivers of biodiversity loss been defined, operationalized, and analyzed in the existing literature?</li>
      <li>Which categories of indirect drivers are most frequently studied?</li>
      <li>Which taxonomic groups and ecological levels are most commonly studied when indirect drivers are examined in relation to direct drivers of biodiversity loss?</li>
      <li>How often and where do direct and indirect drivers of biodiversity loss overlap geographically, and what taxonomic groups are involved?</li>
      <li>What knowledge gaps are there, and what do they entail?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

The structure is as follows:

    - code: ordered scripts to reproduce the flow undertaken for the article (either as a standalone or in an HPC cluster).
        - auxfiles: raw data files required at any given point by any of the scripts.

- The final results of the systematic map are available in the following Zenodo repository: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17153036

- To avoid infringing on any copyright held by academic journals, only article metadata is provided in `txt`, `json`, or `RIS` format.
